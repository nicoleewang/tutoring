# Today: Relational Algebra, Transaction Processing

## Relational Algebra

- is a **low-level formal language** used by **database engines** to understand, optimize, and execute queries
  - SQL code -> Relational algebra similar to how C code -> Machine code

### Operations

Operators take relations (tables) as inputs and produces relations as outputs

Common operators (this course uses its own custom notation, commonly greek letters are used instead)

> ðŸ’¡ note: this is nothing new !! just different notation for things weâ€™ve seen already with sql queries

- **Projection**: `Proj[attributes](Relation)`
  - *Selects* attributes from the relation
- **Selection**: `Sel[expression](Relation)`
  - Filters out tuples in the relation via the expression
  - The fact that this operator is named Selection is a bit confusing, given that Selecting attributes is achieved using the Projection operator :/
- **Join**: 2 types
  - Natural join `R Join S`: joins tuples in R and S that are equal on common attributes
  - Theta join `R Join[expr] S`: the join we're used to seeing
- **Rename**: `Rename[schema](Relation)`
  - Reassigns the schema in the relation
    - Can be used to rename the relation name and/or attribute names

### More complex operators:

- **Set operators**: **Union, Intersection, Difference**
  - note: when using these operators the relations need to have the same structure (i.e. same attributes)
- **Cartesian product** - R1 **X** R2: all pairwise combinations of tuples in R1 and R2
  - The output relation should have the attributes of both relations R1 and R2 combined
  - If R1 has `m` tuples and R2 has `n` tuples: There are `m` times (product) `n` tuples in R1 X R2
- **Division**: R1 **Div** R2:
  - in other words: youâ€™re **filtering the first set** R1 to only include those entries that **match all** items in the second set R2 (remember the tutorial exercises in week 4??)
  - **important:** the **result only includes the attributes in `R1` that are *not* in `R2`**.
  - **reminder:** relational division is only valid when:
    ```
    attributes of R1 âŠ† attributes of R2
    ```
    - i.e. all attributes in R2 exist in R1
  - steps:
    1. **identify the attributes in `R1` that are not in `R2:`** this will be the **heading** (columns) of the result!!
    2. **group the rows in `R1` by those attributes**
    3. **check whether each group contains every combination of values from `R2`**
    4. **keep only the groups that satisfy this condition**, and return the values of the attributes from step 1

## Transactions

A transaction is a bundled set of operations/tasks. It must be ACID:

- **A**tomic
- **C**onsistent
- **I**solated
- **D**urable

### Transaction Scheduling

The order the operations in multiple scheduled transactions are performed

Scenario: Two people, Adam and Bob, share the same bank account with a balance of $1000. Adam deposits $2000 and at the same time (**concurrently**), Bob withdraws $500. Hence, the final balance should be 1000 + 2000 - 500 = 2500

T1 is Adam's transaction  
T2 is Bob's transaction

| **T1**                 | **T2**              | **Database balance after operation** |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| R(B),B = 1000          |                     | 1000                                 |
| B = B + 2000, W(B)     |                     | 3000                                 |
|                        | R(B), B = 3000      | 3000                                 |
|                        | B = B - 500, W(B)   | 2500                                 |

```
T1: R(B) W(B)
T2:           R(B) W(B)

```

The above schedule is aÂ **Serial schedule**Â 
- A serial schedule: each scheduled transaction is executed to completion before starting the next
- **non-interleaving**

## Concurrency

Serial schedules are slower: if there are multiple transactions at once, a transaction must wait for all transactions scheduled before to complete. Thus, the scheduler often **interleaves** transactions to enhance performance

However, interleaving schedules are **potentially dangerous**. Consider the following interleaved scheduling of the scenario above:

| **T1**                  | **T2**               | **Database balance after operation** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| R(B),B = 1000           |                      | 1000                                  |
|                         | R(B), B = 1000       | 1000                                  |
| B = B + 2000, W(B)      |                      | 3000                                  |
|                         | B = B - 500, W(B)    | 500                                   |

```
T1: R(B)      W(B)
T2:      R(B)      W(B)

```

This caused the balance to be **$500**! This is because Bob's withdrawal transaction completely overwrote Adam's deposit transaction

We require our schedules to be **serializable**: equivalent to a serial schedule

---

## Serializable Schedules

Two types of serializability:

### 1. Conflict Serializable

Conflicting operations: Consider two consecutive operations to a resource `X` across two threads `T1` and `T2`:

- **T1: R(X), T2: R(X) does not conflict** â€” both threads read the same `X` even if the order were to be swapped
- **T1: R(X), T2: W(X) does conflict** â€” swapping the order of execution and having `T2` write to `X` first would cause `T1` to read a different value of `X`
- **T1: W(X), T2: R(X) conflicts** â€” for the same reason as above.
- **T1: W(X), T2: W(X) does conflict** â€” swapping the order changes the final version of `X`

> note!! operations only conflict if it accesses the same data item

**To check** - build a **precedence graph**:

- A node for each transaction and an edge for each conflicting pair
- A **cycle** in the graph means the schedule is **not** conflict serializable

---

### 2. View Serializable

All conflict serializable schedules are view serializable, but **not vice versa**

In a view serializable schedule:

- Each thread should **read the same version** of each shared resource as in the serial schedule
- Each resource should be **written to last by the same thread** as in the serial schedule

so you want to first figure out what should be the equivalent serial schedule and compare it with that
